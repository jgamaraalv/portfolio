        <p>
          I began my career at the age of 16 as a <em>Fullstack Developer</em>{" "}
          working with <em>Javascript</em>, <em>jQuery</em>, <em>PHP</em>, and{" "}
          <em>MySQL</em>, and have since grown to specialize in <em>React</em>{" "}
          and <em>Typescript</em> since 2017
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is to create beautiful, easy-to-use, and high-performance
          internet applications. I&apos;m always looking to evolve and stay
          up-to-date with the latest technologies, such as <em>Web3</em>.

        <p>

          - Creating a whole <em>frontend</em> system from scratch, from UI to
